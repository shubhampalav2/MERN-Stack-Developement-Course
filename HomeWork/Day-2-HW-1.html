    <h3>Biography of DSA</h3>
    <p>
        Data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Different types of data structures are suited to different kinds of applications, and some are highly specialized to specific tasks. Some common data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.

An algorithm is a set of steps or procedures for solving a specific problem or performing a particular task. Algorithms are used to manipulate and analyze data, and are an essential part of computer science and software development. An algorithm is usually defined by a set of clear and precise instructions, which can be followed mechanically in order to solve a problem.

Data structures and algorithms are closely related, as the choice of an appropriate data structure can have a significant impact on the efficiency of an algorithm. The design and analysis of efficient algorithms and data structures is a central topic in computer science, and many problems can be solved more efficiently by using a suitable data structure or algorithm.
